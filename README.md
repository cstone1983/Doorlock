Raspberry pi rfid door strike
highest version is always a work in progress and may or may not work. v2 works but it messy. v2 added classes for cleaner code and will continue to clean up code.
v4 will probably introduce subclass. The database connection will be a separate class and tstat connection will prob be a subclass, possibly db actions will be pulled out to an action class or something similiar.
